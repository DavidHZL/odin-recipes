    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds golden yellow potatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dill weed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Toppings (optional) <em>fresh parsley, chives, freshly grated Parmesan cheese </em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Coat a baking sheet with olive oil to protect against potato stick-age.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clean your potatoes (I leave the peels on) and slice them into 1/4-inch-wide sticks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Soak the potatoes in hot water. (Remember, this step is worth it)
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain and dry the potatoes. Toss them with the remaining oil and spices until coated,
            then place them on the baking sheet in a single layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake at 450 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes. Use a spatula to flip the fries, and move them
            into a single layer. Bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until theyâ€™re as crispy as you like.
            Sprinkle with some extra salt to taste.
        </li>
